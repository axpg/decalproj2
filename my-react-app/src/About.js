        <h3>In-vest-ed in A Cappella</h3>
        <p>We’re a lower-voices a cappella group known for our fun performances and fresh takes on popular songs! It always feels sunny when we perform, and not just because of our golden vests!</p>
        <p>Since our founding in 2000, we’ve gone million-view-viral on YouTube multiple times, released an album entirely composed of original songs, and performed at the 2022 UC Berkeley commencement.</p>
